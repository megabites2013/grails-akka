h4. Tricks

Since Grails-2.3 forked execution is enabled by default (in commands run-app, test-app, run-war, console), some info here:
[Grails Command Line|http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/commandLine.html#forkedMode] .

If needed could be disabled (for example only in the test environment) by changing its configuration in BuildConfig.groovy .



h4. Workarounds

None.
