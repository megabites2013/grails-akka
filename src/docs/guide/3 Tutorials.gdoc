h4. Samples

In Plugin sources under the [test|https://github.com/smartiniOnGitHub/grails-akka/tree/master/test/] folder
there there are some initial unit and integration tests,
and even an inline test webapp.

Code is duplicated to avoid unnecessary complexity.

Note that some code is more general than required for tests, but only to show some basic features.


h4. Akka documentation

Look at Akka API for Java, usable from Groovy and Java code,
from here [Akka Java API|http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.3/java.html]
